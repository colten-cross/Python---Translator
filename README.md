# Python---Translator
Selenium - Translator App


This is a Selenium-based program, used to take in English text from the user, and translate the phrase into either Spanish or German.

I created this project to show a quick example of how powerful Selenium can be. In some cases, Selenium can even take the place of what an API would normally help you achieve. 

This small project could easily be taken and developed into something much larger, and I plan on eventually creating a GUI for this app.
